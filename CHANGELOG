* manually forked http://www.hulihanapplications.com/projects/bxr to new GitHub repository
* nixed the unused test directory (and its subdirectories) as it contained only boilerplate tests
* unvendor'd rails (2.2.2); now targeting 2.3.5 (gem version)
* renamed app/controllers/application.rb -> app/controllers/application_controller.rb
* renamed app/views/**/*.rhtml -> app/views/**/*.html.erb
