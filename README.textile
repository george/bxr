h1. BXR

[See also @README_ORIGINAL@]

BXR is an open source, ruby on rails file management system. It is based off of
Boxroom, another ruby on rails application. BXR allows you to create folders, 
users, and groups, and assign permissions, so you can secure different folder 
and files. You can also search for files and folders, either by keyword, or by 
file content. Organization of files is easy! Besides being able to upload files 
to different folders, you can also add specific tags/labels to each file.

This repository is a fork of "http://www.hulihanapplications.com/projects/bxr":http://www.hulihanapplications.com/projects/bxr.
